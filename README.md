# PitchUp Flutter Sample - Guitar tuning app

This app is a sample Flutter Guitar tuning app which demonstrates how to use 2 dart libraries: 

- https://github.com/techpotatoes/pitchup_dart: Dart library to check if a pitch is in tune for a given instrument.
- https://github.com/techpotatoes/pitch_detector_dart: Dart library to detect a pitch for a given audio sample.

Feel free to use these libraries to implement your own beautiful Flutter instrument tuning apps. Respect the LICENSE and contribute if you wish.
